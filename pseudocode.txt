~pseudocode for project~

*include required libraries*

int ultrasonicSensor;
int microServo;
int led;
int bluetooth;
int lcd;
int buzzer;
int capturedValue;
*array/vector of previous captured values*

*setup required devices*

*loop*
- read in values from the ultrasonic sensor and store it in capturedValue

- multiple if-else statements to display specific output for any capturedValue

- if value is too less (i.e. collison occurs), call collison function

- store the value the array

- if certain time has passed -> call the "driving_habit" function 


*collison*
-> rings the buzzer
-> sends notification to the connected user

*driving_habit*
->process the data in array/vector to give specific feedback to the user
->sends notification to the user
